This section of KEV software is intended to calculate the equilibrium
composition of the chemical mixture. The reactions occurring in the mixture as
well as their decimal logarithms of equilibrium constants and total
(equilibrium) concentrations of the reagents should be set as input data
in order to obtain equilibrium concentrations of reagents and products and 
products yields in relation to any chosen reagent.
